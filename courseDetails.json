Whether you've had formal training in motion design, or you've just figured it all out yourself, understanding and implementing these principles will make a huge difference in the quality of your work. That's why I'm so excited to be sharing this knowledge with you here on Skillshare! In this class, I'll be teaching you how to use animation principles in your motion design. But the knowledge you'll gain can be applied to any form of animation - not just in After Effects! You can use them in any animation software, hand-drawn animations, or even stop motion animation. Every principle is universal and applicable to any project.  I've split the class into two units; the first will be where I teach you about these principles, and how to use them through an exercise in After Effects. The second unit is where I'll show you my entire methodology for creating an animation from start to finish. You'll get an in-depth look at how I approach an animation, organize and manage a project, build custom controls for my illustrations, implement animation principles, and export to both GIF and video files. This is an advanced class. You should have a good understanding of Adobe After Effects’ user interface and functionality before taking this class. Every step will be clearly explained in each video, but we won’t be spending time learning how to do basic functions. We'll be using the graph editor extensively, so if you're not familiar with how to use it, check out Animating With Ease first. I hope you're excited to learn about animation principles! I'll see you in class.",

This is an advanced class. You should have a good understanding of Adobe After Effects’ user interface and functionality before taking this class. Every step will be clearly explained in each video, but we won’t be spending time learning how to do basic functions. We'll be using the graph editor extensively, so if you're not familiar with how to use it, check out Animating With Ease first. I hope you're excited to learn about animation principles! I'll see you in class.",

        "details": "Animation principles are an invaluable set of guidelines for creating more appealing motion in your animations. Whether you've had formal training in motion design, or you've just figured it all out yourself, understanding and implementing these principles will make a huge difference in the quality of your work. That's why I'm so excited to be sharing this knowledge with you here on Skillshare! In this class, I'll be teaching you how to use animation principles in your motion design. But the knowledge you'll gain can be applied to any form of animation - not just in After Effects! You can use them in any animation software, hand-drawn animations, or even stop motion animation. Every principle is universal and applicable to any project.  I've split the class into two units; the first will be where I teach you about these principles, and how to use them through an exercise in After Effects. The second unit is where I'll show you my entire methodology for creating an animation from start to finish. You'll get an in-depth look at how I approach an animation, organize and manage a project, build custom controls for my illustrations, implement animation principles, and export to both GIF and video files.

In this course you’ll learn how to draw with dramatic light and shadow.  All form, no matter how complex, follows a basic set of light and shadow rules.  By understanding how light operates on the fundamental volumes like the sphere, cylinder and cube, you’ll be able to realistically shade basic forms and be prepared to draw and shade more complex subjects.  It’s essential that every artist and creative professional know and be able to use these powerful shading tools and techniques. This course is a perfect prerequisite to painting and figure drawing.In this course you’ll learn:How to shade basic volumes using dramatic light and shadow. How light and shadow operate on fundamental volumes. How to recognize and draw fundamental light and shadow patterns including the highlight, core shadow, reflected light and cast shadow.",
